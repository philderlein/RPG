Sequential Battles Simultaneously RPG

-Single Player
-1 player character

-4 battles simultaneously, 4 viewports on screen
-Battles occur sequentially in the game-world, but you see all four at once
-Must defeat all the enemies in the four battles to move on
-Turn-based
	-Player chooses action for each timeline, then the enemies attack
		-Technically 4 characters
	-Actions:
		-Alive actions (while alive)
			-Attack
		-Items
		-Dead actions (while dead)
			-Give Up (Quick Game Over)
			-DonÅft Give Up (skips turn, youÅfre dead ya know)

-Player has no maximum HP, only default HP
	-This simplifies time shenanigans with trying to calculate if a future self would be healed or not
	-HP can go into negative, making it harder to revive a self
	-If HP goes into negative, that self is dead
		-can revive by healing in the past, which carries over to the future
			-must put that self into positive HP before he revives

-Actions in the past carry over to the future
	-Taking damage deals damage to future selves
		-Healing heals future selves as well
	-Some effects are more potent to future selves
	-Poison deals extra damage to future selves
		-You can cure poison to remove the damage to the future selves
-Non-retroactive effects?
	-Future enemies attacking past selves without damaging future selves
	-Heal a specific self, without healing the future selves
	-Enemies dealing damage that works in the reverse?
		-Damage to future self, which carries over into the past?

-What happens if one of your selves die?
	-Every turn heÅfs dead, the enemies chew on him, dealing extra damage
		-Revive him fast by healing in the past, or the negative HP may be too much to overcome
		-That self doesnÅft get his turns back, he was still chewed on all those turns he was ÅgdeadÅh

-What happens if one of the battles ends early?
	-Extra looting time meaning more rewards?
	-Resting, healing the future selves?

-Boss Monsters
	-All 4 battles are the same battle, just at different points in time
	-Boss has same rules as you, damage in the past carries to the future parts
	-To win, must repel/kill boss in every battle
	-Time shenanigans like destroying the BossÅfs sword to remove the damage it dealt in the future(effectively healing your future selves)
	?If boss isnÅft repelled/killed fast enough in a battle, bad things(village ruined, miss out on items, etc)?

-Game Over if:
	-All selves are killed
	-All currently engaged enemies (meaning battles in which your self is still alive) are dead while one of your selves are dead (Basically if you canÅft do anything to revive a self, you lose)
	-You choose ÅgGive UpÅh from a dead self
