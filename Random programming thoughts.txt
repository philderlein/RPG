Random Thoughts about how to code this shit:

Players in array? [0], [1], [2], [3]

Enemies have target variable, tells the enemy which guy to hit.

Start of Battle:
Battle 1:
	
	-Randomize enemy, set target to 1
	-Put enemy in proper place
Battle 2:
	-Randomize enemy, set target to 2
	-Put enemy in proper place
Battle 3:
	-Randomize enemy, set target to 3
	-Put enemy in proper place
Battle 4:
	-Randomize enemy, set target to 4
	-Put enemy in proper place
Start Battle.
Enemies placed in array?

Enemy attacks work on hit player [target], calculate damage, send damage forward up the array.

Logic for turn flow:
-Turn set to 1
-Choose action
-action calls method
	-Attack calls method to choose who to attack
		-calls method that actually attacks
	-Items opens item menu
		-Clicking on item calls item-specific method
			-choose target?
				-Item goes off
-Turn set to 2
	-same shit

-all player turns done
Enemies have multiple attacks
Enemies randomize which attack they call
Enemies call their attack methods sequentially in the array
	-Only 1 attack per enemy though

Enemies attack method calculates based on target in array
	-stores damage dealt and deals it up the array
	-Or store damage and call method of dealing damage to the rest of the selves. Some go backward, some go forward?

End of Battle:
Calculate XP and shit by calling the enemy array and iterating through adding XP and shit together.
